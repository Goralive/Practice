### Technical questions

1. I have spend 6+ hours. As test reporter I would use allure,
also want to add selenoid (selenium-grid) for paralezation of the test and running tests 
on different environments
2. I like to use new tools, virtulization and clouds. The more faster development shoud be covered by
the fast and with great quality tests. You can run a lot of tests using docker and cover diffrent OS and
browsers. That's stuff are like it. Also interesting in API testing with the contracts (pact)
3. Of course. It depends on application mb I propose to cut to microservices. Start to refactor with
not business dependet staff. Ask developers and PO what should be automated first!
4. I would take geolocation of the user and try to give some results of the nearest cafe below
the search (of course some of the cafe can pay money to be on the top of the such list)

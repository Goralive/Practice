### Technical questions

1. I have spend 2-3 hours. I would add cucumber scenarios, as reporter I would use allure,
also tried to use tools like Selenoid
2. I like to use new tools, virtulization and clouds. The more faster development shoud be covered by
the fast and with great quality tests. You can run a lot of tests using docker and cover diffrent OS and
browsers. That's stuff are like it. Also interesting in API testing with the contracts (pact)
3. Of course. It depends on application mb I propose to cut to microservices. Start to refactor with
not business dependet staff. Ask developers and PO what should be automated first!
4. I would take geolocation of the user and try to give some results of the nearest cafe below
the search (of course some of the cafe can pay money to be on the top of the such list)
5.
